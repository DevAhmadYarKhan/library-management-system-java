# Java Library Management System

A robust and feature-rich command-line Library Management System built with core Java. This application allows librarians to manage a diverse media collection, including Books, DVDs, and Games, with persistent storage to a local file.

## Features

- **Media Management:** Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for three media types:
    - **Books:** Store author, publisher, page count, and more.
    - **DVDs:** Store director, studio, languages, duration, and more.
    - **Games:** Store developer, platform, game modes, and more.
- **Advanced Search:** Search the library by unique ID or by title.
- **Persistent Storage:** Automatically saves the entire library to a text file (`MyMedia`) upon exit. Reloads data automatically on startup if the file exists.
- **Input Validation & Error Handling:** Comprehensive validation for all user inputs with clear error messages. Custom exceptions for duplicate IDs and missing media.
- **Detailed Media Information:** Each item stores a rich set of details, including genres and a precise physical location (branch, section, shelf, floor).
- **Object-Oriented Design:** Clean separation of concerns with dedicated packages for models, services, and exceptions.

## Technologies Used

- **Java SE:** Core language features including Collections Framework, File I/O, and Object-Oriented Programming principles.
- **Custom Exceptions:** For elegant and specific error handling.
- **Java.util Collections:** Heavy use of `Map<Integer, Media>`, `Set<String>`, `List<Media>`, etc., for efficient data management.

## Installation & Compilation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/java-library-management.git
    cd java-library-management
    ```

2.  **Compile the Java files:**
    Navigate to the directory containing the `CLI.java` file and run:
    ```bash
    javac -d . CLI.java
    ```
    This will compile all `.java` files in the project and place the `.class` files in the correct package structure.

3.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    java CLI
    ```

## Usage

Upon starting the program, it will attempt to load existing data from the `MyMedia` file. If none is found, it will initialize an empty library.

You are presented with a main menu:

1. Add new media item
2. Remove media item
3. Search media
4. Display all items
5. Save and exit
6. Exit without saving


### Adding an Item
Select option `1` and choose the media type (Book, DVD, Game). The program will guide you through entering all required details, with validation for each field.

### Removing an Item
Select option `2` and enter the ID of the item you wish to remove. You are asked to confirm the deletion.

### Searching
Select option `3` to search by `ID` (returns one item) or by `Title` (returns all matching items).

### Viewing All Items
Select option `4` to print a formatted list of every item in the library to the console.

### Exiting
- Option `5`: Saves the current state of the library to the `MyMedia` file and exits.
- Option `6`: Exits the program without saving any changes made during the session.

## Data Persistence

The library's state is saved to a plain text file named `MyMedia` (with no file extension). The `MediaIO` class is responsible for the custom serialization and deserialization of the complex object graph into a tab-separated values format. This ensures your library persists between sessions.
